**uBlock Origin is now maintained in the core repository**

As the new Microsoft Edge is based on Chromium, development of uBlock Origin for Microsoft is done entirely in the core 
repository, as Microsoft Edge's extension platform is the same as Chromium's. To contribute pull requests or report 
issues, go to the core repository at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock.

**Downloading uBlock Origin for Microsoft Edge**

Check the icon for Edge on your computer and match it to the instructions below:

You can install the latest version of 
[uBlock Origin from the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak).
This is kept up-to-date with the latest version on the Chrome Web Store.

Legacy Edge
</h3>

Due to the complexities and time requirements to maintain compatibility with the legacy version of Microsoft Edge, this
fork is no longer supported. It is **highly recommended** that you upgrade your version of Microsoft Edge by
[downloading the update at Microsoft's website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge). Once you have updated, follow the
instructions above for installation of uBlock Origin on New Edge.
